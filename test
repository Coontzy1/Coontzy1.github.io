TL;DR about me. I come from a healthcare -> Voice Over -> Outside Sales background; zero prior IT/Cyber Security experience.

So when I was grounded from traveling during the great pandemic of 2020, I had a lot of “free” time on my hands. Now, I’ve always been interested in technology and the art of code writing so why not take this time to learn something new. With the help of Uncle Google I came across this free Introduction to Computer Science course that Harvard University was offering (https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science). I was challenged, I learned a lot, and at the end of the day finally understood what “int main (void)” meant…but the 2(ish) hour lecture on Cyber Security that the course covered was what really got me hooked!

Back to Uncle Google I went and started looking for more free content, but this time focusing on Cyber Security. While I did read up on the OSCP, and how it is (was) the golden standard of hacking certs; I couldn’t justify the price (at the time $1,500 ~). So I stumbled across a YouTube content creator named Heath Adams (https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy) and his video “Ethical Hacking in 12 Hours”. I devoured every minute of that video, rewatching and taking notes like a madman…I was hooked.

Turns out, Heath owns a Cybersecurity Company called TCM Security and just lunched a new certification called the PNPT. A the time the price point was $299 for just the cert test or $399 for the new updated training + cert test.
Content and Format

The video content was amazing. The course took you from OSINT gathering -> username enumeration -> light web app attacks/vulns -> Internal Foothold -> AD enumeration and common lateral movement/priv escs -> full domain compromise. Everything you need to pass the PNPT certification exam is in the training.

The format of the exam is, I believe, as close to a real world External/Internal Penetration test as possible. Without giving much away, you start from an external prospective and then have to compromise your way into a “decent” sized AD environment. You get 5 days to complete the test, and an additional 2 days to complete the report. At the end, once the report was submitted, reviewed, and approved you then had a 30-minute debrief with someone from the TCM Security team.
Experience and Takeaways

With this being my only hacking cert (currently), It was a great experience. After failing my first attempt…expecting a “git gut” attitude from TCM and their community, I was met with nothing but positivity. At the end of the day, this isn’t a CTF type challenge. So, after going back to the course, updating my notes, redoing some of the provided labs, I was able to pass the exam in 2-1/2 days.

The knowledge and skills learned from this course and exam set a great foundation for me as a Pentester. What is always great about TCM and the PNPT is they have a huge community of people (via their discord). This was defiantly a positive because at the time I didn’t know anyone in the cyber field, and now have friends across all aspects of the beast that is Cyber Security. I couldn’t recommend this certification enough! While it Is “entry” level, TCM did release a “Junior” version of this exam that is even more appropriate for those brand new to Cyber Security. 10/10, would take this exam again.
